    This AWG can switch between an AWG and an AFG. This driver is for the AWG. There
    is a SCPI command to switch between them but it is not implemented here.
    Each channel has its own sequencer, but to maintain synchronicity, the length of each
    channels' sequence must be the same. Because this is 2021, the AWG helpfully maintains
    a set of strategies to fix length mismatches from which you may choose. As such, the way
    AWG's are specified is "SEQ:ELEM[n]:WAV[m] wfname" where n is the n'th part in the sequence table and
    m is the channel to put the waveform with wfname.
